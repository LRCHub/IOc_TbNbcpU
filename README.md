[00:11.41] Suddenly, you're nowhere to be found
[00:15.62] I turn around and everything has changed
[00:21.60] Looking for a way to work it out
[00:25.78] I'm trying to find some peace to navigate
[00:46.28] 
[00:30.66] The oak tree where I met you
[00:33.05] And the writing on the statue
[00:35.52] I still remember every word you said
[00:39.95] I'm not a soldier but I'm fighting
[00:43.10] Can you hear me through the silence?
[00:45.79] I won't give up 'cause there will be a day
[01:06.79] 
[00:50.07] We'll meet again
[00:58.07] 
[01:00.09] We'll meet again
[01:08.09] 
[01:11.54] Everything we wanted turned to gold (turned to gold)
[01:15.58] The path we chose, the future on our side
[01:21.53] Never thought I'd do this on my own (on my own)
[01:25.65] But now, I wield the sword you left behind
[01:46.65] 
[01:30.56] The oak tree where I met you
[01:33.02] And the writing on the statue
[01:35.55] I still remember every word you said
[01:40.06] I'm not a soldier but I'm fighting
[01:43.03] Can you hear me through the silence?
[01:45.68] I won't give up 'cause there will be a day
[02:06.68] 
[01:49.84] We'll meet again
[01:57.84] 
[01:59.99] We'll meet again
[02:07.99] 
[02:10.82] Dark for the sunrise
[02:13.34] Clouds for a blue sky
[02:15.89] Space for the travelling star
[02:20.85] Strong from the inside
[02:23.44] You're still my lifeline
[02:25.63] I feel you wherever you are
[02:39.13] 
[02:30.58] The oak tree where I met you
[02:33.15] And the writing on the statue
[02:35.66] I still remember every word you said
[02:39.97] I'm not a soldier but I'm fighting
[02:43.02] Can you hear me through the silence?
[02:45.61] I won't give up 'cause there will be a day
[03:06.61] 
[02:49.81] We'll meet again
[02:57.81] 
[02:59.85] We'll meet again
[03:07.85] 
[03:10.16] We'll meet again
